    "Summary": "Gaia Resources, an APN Select Consulting Partner, has created an app called Essential Service Volunteers (ESV) to help emergency services volunteers register, track activities, and access merchant offers to combat bushfires in Australia. The app offers a virtual ID card and enables users to log the duration, location, and type of work they undertake. Brigade captains and local government officials can also obtain statistics about the volunteering efforts of their brigade. The app is free to download, with full functionality available for users who volunteer for an essential service with an active subscription. The app uses Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) for storage, Amazon CloudFront for content delivery, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Beanstalk for automated deployment and management.\n\nGaia Resources worked with the Association of Volunteer Bushfire Brigades of Western Australia (Bushfire Volunteers) to develop the ESV app. Over 75% of the 26,000 firefighters in Western Australia are bushfire volunteers. The app was designed to promote the safety and well-being of bushfire volunteers and provide innovative ways of empowering and recognizing them. AWS contributed platform credits, removing short-term budget concerns for the effort and enabling the association to continue focusing on promoting the safety and well-being of its volunteers.\n\nThe app is being tested in the field to ensure it is fit for purpose, with hundreds of bushfire volunteers already registered and using the app, providing valuable feedback for further improvements ahead of the next fire season. Gaia Resources continues to assist with the project, supporting continued enhancements. The hope is that this app will make the lives of bushfire volunteers easier and be adopted broadly throughout various public service agencies across Australia, using the power of the AWS Cloud to do so with security, scalability, and cost-efficiency that would not be possible any other way."
