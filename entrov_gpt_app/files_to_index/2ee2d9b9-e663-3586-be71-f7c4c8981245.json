    "Summary": "Toyota's Vehicle Data Warehouse (VDW) was facing challenges due to the aging processes and technologies maintaining it, causing tight timelines for data processing and the creation of an add-on process that extracted the data into a data lake for self-service analytics. To modernize its VDW, Toyota worked with Infosys and leveraged Infosys Cobalt to migrate to Amazon Redshift and develop a lake house architecture on AWS that reduced complexities, eliminated the duplication of data, improved data quality, and laid the groundwork for deeper analytics. The modernization also enabled Toyota to integrate DevOps pipelines that simplified development and deployment of new features and capabilities. With faster performance and a more accessible and scalable architecture, the possibilities for advanced analytics are virtually endless, allowing end-users to do advanced analytics, MLOps, or build a model.\n\nToyota Motor Corporation is a global automotive industry leader manufacturing vehicles in 27 countries or regions and marketing the company's products in over 170 countries and regions. Infosys, on the other hand, is a global leader in next-generation digital services and consulting, enabling customers in more than 50 countries to navigate their digital transformation. With over four decades of experience in managing the systems and workings of global enterprises, Infosys steers customers through the digital journey by enabling the enterprise with an AI-powered core that helps prioritize the execution of change and empowering the business with agile digital at scale to deliver performance and customer delight."
