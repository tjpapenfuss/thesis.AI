    "Summary": "Nutrien, a Canadian fertilizer company, has partnered with Spartan Controls, a Systems Integrator for AspenTech, to use AspenTech Inmation to extract data from equipment across plants and enterprises and aggregate it in a data lake on AWS. The aim is to use the data to improve throughput and productivity, predict equipment failures, and generate new analytical insights. Once data from each facility is collected, it flows from the AspenTech Inmation system to AWS through Kafka and AWS IoT Core. Running on AWS helps Nutrien centralize, manage, and contextualize its operational data in an enterprise scalable Industrial Data Platform and use advanced analytics to drive better business outcomes at scale across the organization. \n\nAspenTech\u2019s solution serves as an operational data connectivity, contextualization, and storage solution, collecting different types of data from Nutrien\u2019s industrial operations and transferring it to a data lake on AWS that Nutrien calls its Insights platform. Working from within the Insights platform, various business teams can easily explore the consolidated data and look for ways to improve their business priorities. Moving to a single data lake system on AWS is not just a matter of reducing costs and increasing data access, it\u2019s about enabling teams to securely implement new systems. In some cases, it will also enable plants to migrate off older solutions that are not as secure. The data services team looks forward to extending its use of Amazon Sagemaker and Sagemaker Studio to include the new plant data."
