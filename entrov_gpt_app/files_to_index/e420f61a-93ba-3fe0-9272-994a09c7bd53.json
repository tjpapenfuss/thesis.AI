    "Summary": "Fund Grube, a Spanish beauty, lifestyle, and fashion retailer, recently worked with AWS Partner Network (APN) Advanced Consulting Partner 3Hold Technologies to build a flexible, scalable environment using Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud instances in Amazon Virtual Private Cloud subnets. The retailer uses SAP to run its core business processes, including warehouse management, enterprise resource planning, and point-of-sale management. Fund Grube needed a new hosting infrastructure that would provide the flexibility it needed for the next phase of growth, and moving SAP to the cloud was a priority. The most significant benefit of moving to the cloud is the flexibility Fund Grube has gained, and it now has the tools at its disposal for growth. \n\nThe migration of SAP to AWS took around three months and involved moving eight core business systems from Windows on VMware-based, bare-metal environments to Windows-based ones in the cloud using the AWS Server Migration Service (AWS SMS). The AWS environment comprises Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances inside Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) subnets. After the success of the initial migration, 3Hold and Fund Grube moved the retailer\u2019s e-commerce application to AWS. By moving to the cloud, Fund Grube's internal team has more time to spend on other projects, like a large-scale upgrade of their point-of-sale systems. \n\nFund Grube is a beauty, lifestyle, and fashion retailer with more than 30 stores in Spain\u2019s most popular tourist destinations. Founded in 1983, Fund Grube now employs 500 people and has annual revenues of around \u20ac150 million ($167 million). 3Hold Technologies is an APN Advanced Consulting Partner based in Barcelona and Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain."
