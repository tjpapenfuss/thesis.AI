    "Summary": "The article discusses how GoCheck, a cloud-based pediatric photoscreening application, collaborated with AWS and Provectus, an AWS Premier Consulting Partner, to enhance its image classification component through machine learning (ML). The goal was to improve the usability of the app by supplementing image analysis and improving user actions to capture the best image possible. Provectus delivered a secure, auditable, and reproducible ML training infrastructure deployed on AWS, including a robust experimentation environment with experiment tracking and model versioning, and active learning pipelines for continuous data re-labeling and re-training. The outcome was that GoCheck received a new machine learning infrastructure on AWS to support regular model retraining, evaluation, tuning, and improvements. More efficient data preparation and faster experimentation enabled GoCheck to increase the recall of ML models by 3X while preserving its precision.\n\nThe article also highlights the importance of accurate image analysis and classification algorithms within GoCheck's platform's processing engine, which is critical to screen a child for vision disorders. The company wanted to alert the user in real-time to \"retake\" the image when the image was captured while the child was not looking directly at the camera. The application needed a robust and resilient machine learning infrastructure to prepare data, run experiments on the dataset of 1M+ images, and to build and train new image analysis and classification algorithms faster and more efficiently. Provectus took on the challenge to design, build and implement a machine learning infrastructure to help GoCheck achieve these success criteria.\n\nProvectus delivered a secure and reproducible experimentation and ML training infrastructure, where pipelines are orchestrated and ML models are trained in Kubeflow. Some of the ML models, as well as analytics, were done in Amazon SageMaker. The machine learning infrastructure development and implementation aligns with GoCheck's broader strategy and future product developments. More than 100 experiments were conducted within three weeks on the entire subset data of 150K images, making it possible to test various improvement hypotheses and to re-run every quality hypothesis to determine the best hyperparameters. The machine learning infrastructure helped the Provectus team significantly, and GCK's original classification protocol increased the recall to 91%, while preserving the initial model's precision."
