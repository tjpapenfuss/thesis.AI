    "Summary": "Automat-IT is an advanced consulting partner of the AWS Partner Network (APN) and has been helping enterprises adopt DevOps best practices and move to the AWS Cloud since 2012. The Israel-based company has been focusing on assisting public-sector, financial services, and technology companies to manage their DevOps and cloud environments, including design, build, deployment, and management. Automat-IT works with public-sector customers to accelerate their cloud journeys, and one of its newest customers is the Max Stern Yezreel Valley College, which needed to upgrade its IT environment to support the needs of its 5,000 students.\n\nAs part of the curriculum, students have to access online videos of live and prerecorded lectures. The college relied on outdated software for uploading and encoding videos, which caused performance issues. Automat-IT implemented a new video-streaming solution based on AWS Elemental, a software solution for video encoding, decoding, and transcoding. The solution uses Amazon CloudFront as its content delivery network (CDN) and takes advantage of a serverless architecture featuring AWS Lambda to support critical tasks such as user authentication, security, and video format and resolution. The Max Stern Yezreel Valley College's IT team is now able to focus more time on delivering a better experience for their students, faculty, and administrators, and the college plans to continue its relationship with Automat-IT and AWS.\n\nThe success of the project has led to the college migrating its data backup environment from the data center to AWS, and it intends to develop additional solutions in the future. The college provides BA and MA degrees to over 5,000 students in various fields, including economics, information systems, behavioral sciences, sociology and anthropology, psychology, communications, human services, health administration, nursing, and general studies. Automat-IT is a technology solution provider and consulting organization that delivers DevOps, cloud services, and 24/7 support to large enterprises, startups, and public-sector organizations across the globe."
