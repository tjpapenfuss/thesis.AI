    "Summary": "T-Rex Solutions, an AWS Advanced Consulting Partner, was responsible for modernizing the 2020 US Census, which was the first time the census had been conducted online. T-Rex used AWS Customer Enablement services, including AWS Professional Services and AWS Enterprise Support, to access security assessments and AWS Infrastructure Event Management. The US Census Bureau was determined to modernize the census by utilizing the internet to increase self-response and streamline follow-ups for those who did not initially respond. T-Rex Solutions won the $1.4 billion technical integrator contract to manage these digital advancements. \n\nT-Rex chose AWS and its GovCloud (US) regions to host census systems, which offer FedRAMP compliance and enable the agency to handle sensitive data with high impact risk. Data collection for the census was built with two complementary components: Internet Self Response and Non-Response Follow-Up. In total, the solution used over 4,000 Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud and Amazon Relational Database Service instances. T-Rex worked closely with AWS to ensure the systems were secure and well-architected using AWS best practices. \n\nNumerous improvements resulted from the collaboration between T-Rex and AWS. For example, AWS Professional Services helped T-Rex increase the automation of failover scenarios to ensure continuous operation; even in edge cases. T-Rex also worked to build more resiliency into the already existing Apache Kafka infrastructure so data would be preserved even if the data ingestion system went down. The participation of AWS Professional Services and AWS Enterprise Support during the period of the census ensured continuous operation. The massive, critical effort relying on many new and complex pieces of technology went remarkably smoothly thanks to the close collaboration between T-Rex and AWS."
