    "Summary": "Telstra Purple, an AWS Advanced Consulting Partner, has helped Western Australia's Museum of Performing Arts (MOPA) modernize its aging database system and website using AWS serverless technology. MOPA has a collection of more than 45,000 cataloged items of memorabilia from artists who have performed at His Majesty's Theatre since 1904. Telstra Purple implemented a website and database environment based on AWS Lambda and Amazon DynamoDB and used Amazon Elasticsearch Service to run Elasticsearch across the site. MOPA images are stored on Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), and the museum relies on Amazon CloudFront as the content delivery network for its revamped website. Telstra Purple also helped MOPA enhance its security by moving to AWS, ensuring the preservation of important arts memorabilia.\n\nWith the AWS-based solution, MOPA can scale its website and database on demand, making it easy to add thousands of artifact images and support new customers across the globe. The new database is designed to make researchers' minds dance, to prick, poke, and prod their imaginations with colorful imagery. MOPA is making its collection of memorabilia available to users within and outside of Western Australia. The solution also helped MOPA continue operating during venue closures by enabling people who can't physically be there to interact with the arts online. The MOPA website's interface and searchability have been improved, so users can quickly find the artifact images and data they need. The site is much more responsive on AWS, and it's more intuitive for people to navigate the entire collection."
