    "Summary": "The University of Newcastle, one of Australia's leading regional universities, sought to move to the cloud to support its strategic goals, which led to the appointment of Deloitte and Amazon Web Services (AWS) to deliver a complete migration to the AWS Cloud. The team migrated 139 mission-critical applications to AWS, with additional migration of applications to software as a service, decommissioning a number of applications three months ahead of schedule. Deloitte, an AWS Premier Consulting Partner, successfully led the in-depth migration journey to the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud, in collaboration with the University and AWS. \n\nTo prepare for the migration, Deloitte built a thorough business case and strategy and conducted detailed planning exercises with the University to understand how each application worked. Following the immersion day and initial technical work, Deloitte worked with the University to migrate 139 applications to AWS, including the mission-critical student management system (NUSTAR) and key finance systems. Ultimately, Deloitte helped the University replatform 72 percent and refactor 23 percent of its application suite. \n\nBy running its applications on AWS, the University of Newcastle can better deliver on its Environmental Sustainability Plan 2019\u20132025. In line with its initial sustainability vision, the University is well on its way to becoming carbon-neutral by 2025, having attained 100 percent renewable energy supply in 2020. The University has reduced its carbon footprint by implementing a cloud-first strategy that removes the need to build a new physical data center and associated infrastructure on campus."
