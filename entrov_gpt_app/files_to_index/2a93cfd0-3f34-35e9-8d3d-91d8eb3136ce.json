    "Summary": "Mox Bank Limited is a cloud-native, mobile-only, and digital bank that was developed as a joint venture between Standard Chartered, HKT, PCCW, and Trip.com. Mox wanted to move away from the legacy technology constraints to set the company on a long-term innovative path for future success. They enlisted GFT and AWS to help validate technology choices and integrate the selected components into a single banking stack. GFT helped Mox create a new virtual bank that puts the customer at the heart of everything it does. GFT deployed 70 advanced engineers to help design and stand up a virtual, full-stack bank in under 18 months.\n\nMox uses Thought Machine's core banking system, Vault, and deploys it on AWS Cloud Services alongside other SaaS solutions. Vault allows its clients to develop financial products as code using Thought Machine's smart contracts system. The full-stack bank uses AWS for its underlying infrastructure. Today, a new Mox customer can be onboarded in under three minutes by leveraging event-driven architecture on AWS to prioritize activities and using smart contracts to update applications quickly.\n\nBuilding on AWS enables faster innovation by making it easy to integrate new components and providing a cost-effective environment for deploying microservices. Traditional banks that operate legacy on-premises technology have to rely on careful customer forecasts to plan their investments and their product roadmap. By building on the cloud, Mox was able to start small and operate the bank at a substantially lower cost base, but with technology that can scale as customer numbers grow."
