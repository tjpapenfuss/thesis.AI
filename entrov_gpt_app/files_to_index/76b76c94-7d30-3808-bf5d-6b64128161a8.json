    "Summary": "RasSystem, a Brazilian technology company, offers a scalable solution for municipalities to monitor urban street cleaning and waste collection services. The company's software-as-a-service (SaaS) solution, RasCol, uses Internet of Things (IoT) devices and GPS to track mobile resources used in urban cleaning operations. The SaaS solution is powered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud services, including Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) for PostgreSQL, Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), and Amazon Glacier. The RasCol software provides real-time insight into city services, allowing city officials to estimate the daily demand for street cleaning and waste removal, improve street-cleaning plans, and coordinate grass cutting and curb painting operations. \n\nUsing the RasCol solution, the municipality of Recife, one of Brazil's largest cities, improved its urban cleaning program by monitoring 26 cleaning services. The software allowed engineering consultants TPF Engenharia to track improvements via key performance indicators. Since adopting the RasCol solution, the regularity of cleaning operations has improved by 15 percent, and the number of kilometers cleaned per month has decreased from 25,000 to 11,000. Recife now maintains better control over its monthly budget allotted to cleaning and has realized greater operational efficiency and transparency over its urban waste services. Knowing that the RasCol software relies on AWS Cloud has been tremendously important to the success realized by Recife in improving urban waste collection. \n\nThe RasCol SaaS solution is scalable because of AWS and can be online in one week, according to Alex Pires de Camargo, Chief Technology Officer at RasSystem. The IoT tracking devices transmit data to the cloud so that RasCol software users can see the progress of urban cleaning and collection operations in real time. The system tracks where cleaning vehicles are located, which streets have been cleaned, and at what time and notes if cleaning teams are behind schedule. The software also allows cleaning teams to document their work by taking photos before and after each cleaning stop, and the data can be used to alert city officials to overgrown vegetation preventing clean-up operations, drain obstructions, and which dwellings or businesses are large waste generators."
