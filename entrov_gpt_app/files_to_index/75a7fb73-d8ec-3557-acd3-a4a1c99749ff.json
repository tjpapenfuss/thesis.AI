    "Summary": "UnionBank, a pioneering bank in the use of blockchain technology in the Philippines, has partnered with ConsenSys, an AWS Partner Network (APN) Advanced Technology Partner, to improve banking access for rural-based Filipinos. Rural banks are excluded financially and have little or no banking access to conduct transactions. The lack of resources and inclusion with larger banking institutions has made it nearly impossible for rural banks to thrive or even survive. UnionBank and ConsenSys are using blockchain technology to drive future banking practices and inclusivity in the Philippines. \n\nThe project, called Project i2i, introduces a domestic remittance network using tokens on a private blockchain platform. Until today, rural banks have manually processed tasks for domestic remittances and BSP compliance. With blockchain-based processes, rural bank employees will have more time to serve customers, rather than processing back-office transactions and administrative tasks. Project i2i will create a decentralized, cost-efficient, and near real-time network allowing for the execution of domestic payments that don't rely on existing infrastructure and intermediaries. \n\nThe Kaleido all-in-one blockchain platform helps accelerate and simplify the use of blockchain technology for security-conscious companies. UnionBank used Kaleido to address the challenges of building a multi-organization blockchain network and quickly moved from concept to execution. Participation in Project i2i provides rural banks with many benefits, including improved connectivity, growth, and sustainability. The project has the potential to help the financial industry in the Philippines address several use cases and bring financial inclusion to millions of unbanked Filipinos."
