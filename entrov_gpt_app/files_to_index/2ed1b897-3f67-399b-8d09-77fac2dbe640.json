    "Summary": "The Alvin Municipal Court in Texas, USA worked with AWS Public Sector Partner Tyler Technologies to implement a virtual court solution in under 24 hours, after closing its doors in response to the Texas Supreme Court\u2019s emergency order to postpone all in-person hearings. With the new platform, Alvin cleared its backlog of 800 court cases that had stacked up during the shutdown, reduced the failure-to-appear rate by 60%, and saved thousands of taxpayer dollars. The City of Alvin chose Tyler Technologies, which is an AWS Advanced Technology Partner and an AWS Public Sector Partner, to provide Tyler Virtual Court, a platform for conducting face-to-face court sessions online. The solution is based on clusters that run on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) and uses Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) to store court documents and Amazon DynamoDB to hold the status of a defendant.\n\nEmployees with the Alvin Municipal Court used Tyler Virtual Court to perform their tasks from home on laptops or other devices. As a result, the city quickly caught up with its workload during the shutdown. Tyler Virtual Court also gives defendants a more convenient way to attend court hearings. For example, defendants in traffic violation cases can resolve them without having to physically enter the court. Defendants can even attend arraignment hearings from their cars, using their mobile devices to join online. Using Tyler Virtual Court, the City of Alvin spends less money on paper-based manual processes, staff hours, and additional in-person security. Tyler Technologies plans to expand Tyler Virtual Court to make the court process easier for judges and prosecutors."
