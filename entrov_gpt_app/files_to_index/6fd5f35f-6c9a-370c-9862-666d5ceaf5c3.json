    "Summary": "The APN Home website features a success story about Webstep, an APN Advanced Consulting Partner, and their partnership with Ambita, a Norwegian integrator of property services. Webstep helped Ambita move its data center to the cloud, enabling them to cut server count by half, consolidate their infrastructure team, and cut operational costs by 40%. With their entire IT infrastructure now hosted on AWS, Ambita has experienced a 10x increase in development speed, allowing them to rapidly innovate and bring new customer pilots to market. \n\nAmbita faced challenges in adapting to fast-changing customer demand and competition from other providers of real estate technology. They needed a more dynamic platform that supported their efforts in DevOps and infrastructure as code while allowing them to focus on their expertise in property data solutions. Webstep helped Ambita assemble a cloud center of excellence team to lead an in-depth planning process. With so much of the work performed upfront, the main migration simply required pointing the build servers to Amazon EC2 and Amazon S3. Subsequently, the team migrated all databases to the PostgreSQL-compatible edition of Amazon Aurora and relied on Amazon CloudFront as a content delivery network. \n\nThe migration enabled Ambita to decrease its server count from 600 to less than half that number, cut operational costs by 40%, and reduce the number of employees dedicated to infrastructure from eight to two. It has greatly accelerated innovation and enabled Ambita to roll out pilot projects for customers quickly and effortlessly. Elasticity allows the organization to use only the resources it needs to respond to changing conditions, and AWS helps Ambita deliver on their customer's demands for more frequent reports and fresher data. The organization is looking ahead to using AWS services in new and inventive ways, such as furthering its use of AWS Lambda serverless computing."
