    "Summary": "This article discusses the development of the NASA Image and Video Library, which provides easy access to more than 140,000 still images, audio recordings, and videos, documenting NASA's achievements in exploring space. Before the library was created, each of NASA's 10 field centers made its imagery available online, making it difficult to find specific content. The article outlines the challenges that NASA faced when trying to provide a one-stop-shop for their media, including difficulties in categorizing imagery. \n\nThe solution was to start over and develop a cloud-native solution. In 2014, all the necessary pieces for a second attempt were in place, including the development and publication of a common metadata standard, the Web Enterprise Service Technologies (WESTPrime) service contract, and the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP). The Imagery Experts Program developed the new NASA Image and Video Library, and ManTech International, an Advanced Consulting Partner of the AWS Partner Network (APN), built the solution on Amazon Web Services (AWS). \n\nThe library formally launched in March 2017 and offers several key features, including a user interface that automatically scales for PCs, tablets, and mobile phones across virtually every browser and operating system, a search interface that lets people easily find what they're looking for, and the ability to easily download or share any media found on the site. The library is also fully compliant with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, which requires federal agencies to make their technology solutions accessible to people with disabilities."
