    "Summary": "Best Friends Animal Society (BFAS) is a national animal welfare organization that has been working to end the killing of dogs and cats in shelters for over 30 years. To support its data-driven strategy, BFAS migrated many of its critical applications to Amazon Web Services (AWS) and began using N2WS Backup & Recovery solution through AWS Marketplace to provide a comprehensive backup and disaster recovery data protection solution. N2WS allows BFAS to reduce synchronization time from production to development environments from days to an hour, which enables its IT department to focus on developing value-added initiatives to save animal lives. The organization is now exploring serverless technologies, machine learning, and applying predictive analytics to optimize shelter transport planning before a natural disaster strikes or identify clear patterns of adoptable animal availability in particular regions.\n\nBFAS has grown its AWS footprint from three accounts to 15 and runs 75-100 Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances on any given day. The organization has implemented the N2WS Resource Control feature to help manage powering on and off development environments, leading to a direct decrease in its monthly Amazon EC2 costs. BFAS sees no end to N2WS' status as its strategic partner, as the company continues to innovate and move beyond backup and recovery to help customers manage their data and optimize their costs on AWS."
