    "Summary": "IntelliGuard, a provider of RFID inventory management systems for healthcare and life sciences, migrated from Microsoft Azure to Amazon Web Services (AWS) with the help of Six Nines, an APN Premier Consulting Partner. IntelliGuard's RFID data is stored using Microsoft SQL Server, so the company initially migrated to Microsoft Azure. However, it struggled with scalability, flexibility, and cost optimisation. After working with Six Nines over eight weeks to build a multi-Availability Zone (AZ), HIPAA-compliant infrastructure for its platform on AWS, IntelliGuard can now deploy its entire system in 30 minutes and take advantage of a continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline to shorten its application release cycle times.\n \nSix Nines has helped hundreds of organisations migrate to AWS over the past decade with a specialised focus on Windows Workloads. The company's reputation and proven experience with Microsoft workloads on AWS, DevOps, and HIPAA frameworks stood out to IntelliGuard. IntelliGuard and Six Nines kicked off the engagement with an architecture review and discussion regarding IntelliGuard's desired outcomes on AWS. Six Nines recommended and then helped IntelliGuard execute a multi-phase migration to AWS. Given that IntelliGuard needed to whitelist its front-end IPs with a large number of hospitals, some data needed to stay in Azure while Six Nines and IntelliGuard began the initial migration.\n \nIntelliGuard's RFID solutions offer automation for the management of pharmaceutical inventory and critical care supplies. The company is working on a progression to move application loads into Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) to take advantage of serverless computing. IntelliGuard continues to facilitate and complete many integrations with hospital electronic health records systems and devices through AWS, given the rapid pace at which AWS services are becoming HIPAA-certified."
