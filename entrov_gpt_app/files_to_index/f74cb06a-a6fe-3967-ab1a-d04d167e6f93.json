    "Summary": "Madrile\u00f1a Red de Gas (MRG), the third-largest gas distributor in Spain, has migrated to Amazon Web Services (AWS) to reduce operating expenses and service delivery times with the help of AWS Partner Network (APN) Partner Linke. MRG replatformed its critical SAP systems from Windows to Linux and used AWS Elastic Beanstalk and Amazon WorkSpaces to migrate non-SAP applications in less than 100 days. MRG is a regulated business, which means that it gets a fixed remuneration per connection point and must comply with rules about gas balancing. MRG previously used a local hosting provider to manage its infrastructure, but the company was limited by the power of the physical machines it ran on. MRG lacked the in-house skills and capacity to migrate to AWS, so it selected APN Premier Consulting Partner Linke, an SAP and Migration Competency Partner to manage the migration. Linke moved 90% of MRG's workloads within two months, using AWS Elastic Beanstalk to automate the allocation of resources required for each non-SAP application, leaving ample time to optimize the more complex applications, such as SAP, to run in the cloud. The most immediate benefit for MRG has been the flexibility it has gained in the cloud. It can shrink or grow resources on demand according to business need, resulting in around 10% lower costs. MRG can also get services to its internal users faster, enhancing productivity and service levels. The execution times for transactions and batch processes on SAP systems at MRG have improved too. Employees can now access customer data, certify orders, or list suppliers in around half the time it used to take, enhancing productivity and service levels. MRG has taken the opportunity to reframe its service-level agreements with Linke to focus on user experience rather than IT metrics. With the migration complete, MRG can focus on reducing costs and redesigning some apps to work better in the cloud."
