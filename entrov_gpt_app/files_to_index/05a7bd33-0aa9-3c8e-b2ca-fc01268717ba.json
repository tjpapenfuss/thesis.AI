    "Summary": "OnScale, a provider of engineering simulation software, has launched a Solver-as-a-Service platform to help engineers access high-end computing and software resources. OnScale's multi-domain, multi-physics solvers and cloud HPC computing platform offer the capability to run large analyses using AWS to deliver results quickly and cost-effectively. The service aims to overcome traditional licensing models and hardware costs that can limit the capacity of simulations, which can in turn limit innovation. OnScale's solution was developed in conjunction with AWS partner, nClouds, which provided the expertise to migrate OnScale to AWS and architect a solution that took advantage of AWS capabilities.  \n\nOnScale's software can be deployed to AWS, and simulations are run in parallel on AWS cloud containers, with data stored in private buckets on S3, encrypted at all times and inaccessible outside of AWS. The solution uses AWS data encryption schemas to encrypt data while in transit via SSL with 256-bit AES encryption. OnScale's CEO, Ian Campbell, said the solution would enable engineers to run simulations more often and more quickly, and allow them to tackle more complex problems. \n\nOnScale's SaaS platform on AWS is now generally available. The company is focused on IoT sensors, 5G RF connectors, BioMed and ADAS (driverless cars)."
