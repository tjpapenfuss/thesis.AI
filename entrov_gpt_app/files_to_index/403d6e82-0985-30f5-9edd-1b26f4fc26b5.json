    "Summary": "BMC Software Inc., a US multinational firm delivering information technology and services solutions, used the AWS SaaS Factory Program to develop a software-as-a-service (SaaS) version of Control-M, a long-running and popular product. BMC wanted expert guidance to develop a top-notch SaaS version of Control-M, and by participating in the AWS SaaS Factory Program, BMC received helpful insights into the business and technical aspects of SaaS development. With guidance from the AWS SaaS Factory Program team, BMC optimized costs, improved business agility through various models and approaches, and reviewed plans to improve operational resiliency as it prepared its SaaS solution to go to market. \n\nBMC had been part of the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Partner Network (APN) since August 2013, but it was not fully aware of the AWS SaaS Factory Program until it began investigating cloud vendors to help develop its new SaaS version of Control-M. By joining the AWS SaaS Factory Program, BMC experienced the smooth and successful development of its new BMC Helix Control-M platform while enjoying cost savings and improving its business agility, operational resiliency, and staff productivity. Plus, the new product offers customers the advantages in cost, time, accessibility, and compatibility that are making SaaS so popular across industries today. \n\nLaunched in December 2020, the BMC Helix Control-M SaaS offer provides visibility, reliability, and governance in production, significantly reducing the risks and hidden costs that might result from using disparate application and data workflow automation and orchestration tools. It also drives agility for all personas, with a \"Jobs-as-Code\" interface for developers and a web interface for operations and business users to build, run, and manage all application workflows and business services from a single-enterprise view. In addition, the new product helps accelerate business value with its deep operational and enterprise-scale production capabilities, out-of-the box integrations, and one-time interface development capability."
