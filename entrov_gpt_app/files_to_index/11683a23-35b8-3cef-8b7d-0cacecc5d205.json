    "Summary": "DXC Technology, an end-to-end IT services provider, has partnered with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to improve customer experience and cut costs by 30-40% using cloud-based call centers. DXC Technology used Amazon Connect for automated personalization on customer calls, Amazon Polly for text-to-speech technology, and AWS Lambda to integrate clients\u2019 CRM and ERP software with Amazon Connect. By applying complementary AWS machine learning services such as Amazon Polly for text-to-speech technology, Amazon Lex to enable conversational bots, and Amazon Pinpoint for personalized messaging, DXC Technology is enhancing the customer experience. \n\nAmazon Connect can personalize and automate calls or chats, greet customers by name, predict why they are communicating, and resolve their issues or connect them to a service desk operator when needed. Furthermore, Amazon Connect and AWS Lambda make it easy to differentiate and enhance the service experience by accessing data from disparate systems and sources. DXC has been able to automate password resets, reducing the number of calls that get transferred to an agent by 30-60%. The company has reduced the lead time to edit and change call flow messaging on its IVR system from two months to hours, thanks to Amazon Polly. \n\nDXC Technology is an AWS Partner Network (APN) Premier Consulting Partner that helps its clients transition to a cloud-based architecture. The company is both a customer of Amazon Connect and a vendor, offering call centers as a service built on Amazon Connect to its global clients. DXC Technology anticipates an internal cost reduction of 30-40% as a result of implementing Amazon Connect, thanks to increased automation and improved productivity on each call."
