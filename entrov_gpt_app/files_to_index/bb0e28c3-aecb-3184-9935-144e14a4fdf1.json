The company offers a single software as a service-based cloud security solution for workload and data protection, cloud security posture management, vulnerability management, and compliance management. Orca Security became an AWS Partner to strengthen its ability to protect AWS workloads and access AWS resources that would validate its security posture to its customers. Since joining the AWS Partner Network, Orca Security has accelerated its growth and expanded its customer base by 305% in 2021, achieving unicorn status and $1.2 billion in valuation in two years.\n\nOrca Security develops cloud-native security technology to replace multiple tools, including legacy vulnerability management solutions, cloud workload and data protection solutions, and cloud security posture management solutions. The company earned a 2021 Gartner Cool Vendor award in cloud security posture management for its capabilities across these categories. Orca Security's solution deploys and scales instantly, so its customers can gain greater visibility into their cloud environments, filter false positives from critical alerts, and begin acting on security risks in minutes. Orca Security is all in on AWS and develops solutions that protect AWS workloads, including those running on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud.\n\nOrca Security is a member of multiple AWS Partner programs, including the AWS ISV Accelerate Program, a co-sell program for AWS Partners that provide software solutions that run on or connect to AWS services. This program helps drive new business and accelerate sales cycles by connecting participating AWS Partners with the AWS Sales organization. Since joining the AWS ISV Accelerate Program in early 2021, Orca Security has increased its customer base and fostered significant growth. Orca Security is also one of only nine vulnerability management providers that have achieved an AWS Security ISV Competency. Obtaining this AWS Competency enabled Orca Security to further differentiate its services from those of its competitors."
