    "Summary": "The Deutsche Bahn, one of Europe's largest rail transport providers, has migrated its SAP systems to the AWS cloud resulting in server deployment within minutes, report generation within seconds, and cost savings of 50-60% for third-party applications. The migration involved the transfer of SAP workloads from on-premise environments to over 100 AWS environments using Amazon EC2 and Amazon Elastic Block Store. DB Systel, an AWS-Advanced consulting partner, led the migration of the company's 27 SAP applications, including the largest SAP maintenance installation in Europe with 8,000 users managing 2.2 million maintenance orders annually for 650,000 trains and buses.\n \nWith the migration, DB Systel has created over 100 environments for SAP migration to the AWS cloud, deploying 366 Amazon EC2 instances and using Amazon Elastic Block Store to provide high-performance block storage for 260 TB of data. The company utilised AWS Key Management Service to manage the keys used to encrypt or digitally sign data and AWS PrivateLink to simplify the security of shared data. The migration has allowed the Deutsche Bahn to improve performance and security of its SAP systems and has resulted in cost savings of up to 60% for third-party applications.\n\nThe migration to AWS has provided Deutsche Bahn with the agility to implement innovations quickly, which was difficult to achieve with its on-premise environment. The company has been able to improve performance and security of its SAP systems by using AWS services such as AWS CodeCommit, AWS Cloud Development Kit, and Ansible for Infrastructure-as-Code administration. The company has also replaced expensive application management systems with AWS services, which could lead to cost savings of up to 60%. The migration has allowed DB Systel to focus on innovation and experiment with new ideas."
