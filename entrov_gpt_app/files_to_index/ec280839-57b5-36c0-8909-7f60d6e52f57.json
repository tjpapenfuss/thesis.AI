    "Summary": "Command Alkon, a global leader in integrated technology solutions for the heavy building materials industry, uses Rockset with Amazon DynamoDB to power its cloud-based CONNEX construction materials logistics platform. Rockset offers a real-time indexing database for serving fast search and analytics at scale. Using Rockset to index and analyze data from DynamoDB, Command Alkon is able to deliver real-time analytics on its platform even when usage patterns are not known in advance. The serverless architecture afforded by the combination of DynamoDB and Rockset allows Command Alkon to scale without operational burden. \n\nConstruction projects are sustained by steady incoming streams of building materials. Command Alkon, a leading provider of cloud-based construction software, provides the software backbone for much of the data flowing through construction materials logistics today, handling over 80% of concrete delivery tickets in North America and tracking millions of material and haul tickets on a daily basis. Its CONNEX platform surfaces data and analytics to users across the supply chain to keep construction projects running according to plan. In CONNEX, users can analyze tickets in various ways, filtering and searching across fields in the ticket data. \n\nAs experienced data practitioners, the Command Alkon team recognized early on that indexing could help accelerate queries and deliver the performance needed by the CONNEX application. They chose to use Rockset to index and analyze the data from DynamoDB. Rockset stores all data in its Converged Index\u2122, which combines an inverted index, a columnar index, and a row index. The Command Alkon team pointed to the flexibility that Rockset offered as the most significant benefit they experienced when building on Rockset."
