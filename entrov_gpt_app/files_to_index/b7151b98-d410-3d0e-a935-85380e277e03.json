    "Summary": "IronNet Inc. has teamed up with AWS to deploy their Collective Defense cybersecurity platform to protect the New York power grid from well-funded and nation-state-sponsored threats. IronNet's solution helps organizations to secure their networks by delivering a Collective Defense platform that operates at scale, powered by Amazon EC2 servers and Amazon S3 storage. The New York Power Authority (NYPA) implemented pilot tests in three municipalities to bring the solution to the New York energy ecosystem. The solution provides greater visibility into unknown attacks and can detect and gain visibility into threats on the network edge before they breach digital assets. \n\nThe pilot was crucial as municipalities and state agencies do not have time to look at a solution that is not immediately actionable. IronNet provides a security solution that has been proven to work in the utility ecosystem, and the blueprint they have created with AWS and NYPA is applicable to any ecosystem, whether it is an industry or a state association. The solution is a shift in cybersecurity so that teams from different organizations can share information and work together. AWS has been an essential cloud provider in the development of the solution. \n\nIn summary, IronNet and AWS have joined forces to protect the New York power grid from nation-state-sponsored threats. Their Collective Defense cybersecurity platform operates at scale, providing greater visibility into unknown attacks and detecting threats on the network edge before they breach digital assets. The solution has undergone pilot tests in three municipalities and is a blueprint that can be applied to any ecosystem, thanks to the help of AWS and NYPA.
