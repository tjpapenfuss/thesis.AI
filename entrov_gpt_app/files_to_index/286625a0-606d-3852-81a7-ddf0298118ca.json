    "Summary": "EnerAllies is a private technology company based in Silicon Valley that provides an integrated suite of software and services, which focuses on reducing HVAC energy costs, saving on equipment repairs, improving site comfort, and enhancing staff productivity. EnerAllies works with mid-market and enterprise-scale retail and restaurant chains to reduce energy and maintenance spend. The company needed a robust, cost-efficient infrastructure to reliably and securely connect a rapidly growing network of smart-connected thermostats and other IoT devices. EnerAllies intelligent HVAC Management and Optimization System dynamically connects devices across customer sites, constantly optimizing energy savings, equipment health, and comfort in real-time at the individual device level. \n\nEnerAllies collaborated with AWS Advanced Consulting Partner Cambridge Technology to move from a proprietary IoT system and infrastructure to the AWS platform and services. Cambridge Technology helped EnerAllies use AWS to build a diagnostic platform that monitors on-premise equipment so customers can be notified of impending issues. The AWS IoT solution for EnerAllies is built on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), because of its 99.95 percent availability, and Amazon Aurora database technology, which features a fully distributed self-healing storage system. \n\nThe solution also makes use of the Amazon Machine Learning toolset, which enables the application of algorithms and deep learning from pattern detection coupled with the generation and refinement of predictive models for equipment health status, energy savings optimization, and comfort optimization. AWS IoT gives EnerAllies the ability to rapidly scale, ensure comprehensive security, and manage a high volume of messaging, all at a cost-effective price."
