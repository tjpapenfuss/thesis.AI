    "Summary": "ChaosSearch is a fully managed, secure log search analytics service on AWS, aimed at helping companies search and analyze data from within Amazon S3. The platform is built on an indexing technology developed by founder and chief technical officer, Thomas Hazel. To solve the challenge of helping users unlock the potential of their data on Amazon S3, ChaosSearch needed to provide single sign-on (SSO) for its enterprise users and chose to leverage Auth0 for federated identity support on AWS. Using Auth0, the company can help save time for both itself and its users, while making their life easier. Auth0 drastically reduces the time it takes to securely onboard new users and has been vital for the ChaosSearch team as they have launched automated free trials through their website.\n\nChaosSearch's goal is to deliver best-in-class log management, security, and compliance logging along with an Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana (ELK) alternative that helps businesses scale and simplifies data management. The platform is designed to help companies take advantage of the data they collect by making it easy to access and analyze. The company's architecture on AWS is simple yet elegant, taking substantial advantage of Amazon S3 and internal tooling the company has built.\n\nChaosSearch decided to use Auth0 for federated identity support after evaluating different APN solutions. Auth0 is the only third-party software ChaosSearch uses. It helps the company make user access for organizations as smooth and secure as possible, enabling organizations to create users quickly and seamlessly, and providing SSO. Auth0 also drastically reduces the time it takes to securely onboard new users, which has been vital for the team as they've launched automated free trials through their website."
