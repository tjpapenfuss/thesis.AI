    "Summary": "Deluxe Entertainment Services is a leading video creation to distribution company that manages the digital content supply chain for major content providers like Netflix, Disney, and Amazon. With over 100 years of history, Deluxe has transformed its business model from physical to digital in the past couple of decades. Deluxe has embraced a cloud-first approach and chosen AWS to meet its scalability needs and drive innovation. The company has moved 75% of its production workflow systems to the cloud and developed Deluxe One, a cloud-based platform unifying the media supply chain. Deluxe also relies on SAP to run many critical processes within core financials and capital project management. After migrating much of its SAP footprint to AWS, Deluxe has gained superior reliability, efficiency, and flexibility. The company plans to re-implement its architecture on SAP S/4HANA to optimize and improve its existing SAP architecture.\n\nCapgemini, an APN Premier Consulting Partner, has helped Deluxe migrate its SAP environment to the AWS Cloud two years ago, which was a seamless process for Deluxe. The team is working closely with internal teams to design its architecture to fully utilize SAP to manage rate cards, pricing, billing and VAT, acting as a backend for the Deluxe One platform. Running SAP on AWS has provided Deluxe with superior reliability, efficiency, and flexibility. The company is in the beginning stages of expanding its integration of SAP with the Deluxe One platform. The company plans to begin its S/4HANA implementation shortly to empower it with quick and easy integrations with SAP and legacy systems during future acquisitions."
