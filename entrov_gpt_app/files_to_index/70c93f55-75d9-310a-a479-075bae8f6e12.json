    "Summary": "Arthrex, a global leader in surgical technology, partnered with Rackspace to create a cloud-based digital communications portal on Amazon Web Services (AWS) to reimagine and modernize the post-surgery experience. The solution provides surgeons with customizable, post-operative templates they can quickly populate and make available for patients to access on-demand through a secure, HIPAA-compliant interface. Rackspace leveraged the scalability of AWS and its highly secure infrastructure to upload and share comprehensive post-surgery reports, including image and video files accessed directly from Arthrex\u2019s medical imaging technology in the operating room. Traditional methods of communication often fall short for both surgeons and patients, leaving room to improve the patient experience. \n\nIn just 12 months, Rackspace created a communication portal on AWS that provides convenient templates for surgeons to send easy-to-understand, post-operative reports to patients. With the data stored safely and securely on AWS, Rackspace built a template for surgeons to easily plug in images, instructions, and video messages for their patients. Patients receive a secure login portal and credentials, and they can access their post-operative report anywhere and anytime\u2014and be confident that their private information is secure by HIPAA standards. Arthrex\u2019s post-operative, surgeon-to-patient portal makes communication easy and consistent, leading to improved patient satisfaction. \n\nArthrex\u2019s digital portal allows surgeons to record video messages, include links to relevant studies, and draw on an extensive library of medical imagery, as well as images taken during the surgery. Having this information in a digital format for posterity eliminates lost documentation and subsequent follow-up appointments for reassurance. With a mission to help surgeons treat their patients better, Arthrex is a global medical device company and leader in new product development and medical education in surgical technology. Rackspace Technology is a leading end-to-end multicloud technology services company that designs, builds, and operates customers\u2019 cloud environments across all major technology platforms."
