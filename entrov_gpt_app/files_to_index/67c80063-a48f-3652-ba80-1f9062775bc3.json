    "Summary": "Prodea is a company that provides an IoT cloud platform-as-a-service designed for manufacturers of mass-market, consumer products for the home. The company's platform enables manufacturers to transform traditional consumer products into connected devices, acquire and transmit usage and device data in formats that power business intelligence systems, and enable device interoperability through cloud-to-cloud integration with major third-party ecosystems. Prodea was facing a challenge of slow, resource-intensive software releases. All software deployment was performed manually, and the lack of an integrated DevOps approach posed several challenges. They enlisted the aid of nClouds, an Advanced Consulting Partner of the AWS Partner Network (APN), to help facilitate its DevOps journey. \n\nnClouds helped Prodea move from a cumbersome, manual deployment process to a fully automated deployment pipeline in the cloud. The project has led to several benefits: Prodea's acquisition of Arrayent in July 2017 is perhaps the greatest indicator of new business value. \"Our ability to adapt to change-to be agile-was a key reason for our acquisition,\" says Sinclair. \"We're still working on extending and accelerating our DevOps journey. Part of that now includes replicating what we've already accomplished within the rest of Prodea.\" The team built development and staging environments on AWS, and the first consumer of the new pipeline was their QA department, enabling them to catch issues early in the process. Testing time for a deployment has been reduced from days to hours, and they can now deploy new code multiple times a day instead of the process taking months like it did in the past.  \n\nIn conclusion, Prodea was able to overcome their challenge of slow, resource-intensive software releases with the help of nClouds by moving from a cumbersome, manual deployment process to a fully automated deployment pipeline in the cloud. This project has led to several benefits, including reducing testing time for a deployment from days to hours and enabling them to deploy new code multiple times a day."
