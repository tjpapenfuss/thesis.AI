    "Summary": "Axial3D, an AWS Select Technology Partner and member of the APN Public Sector Partner Program, helps surgeons save lives by creating and delivering detailed preoperative 3D medical models using AWS. The company provides patient-specific, accurate 3D-printed models that can be created quickly, reducing the time it takes to produce the models from six to eight weeks to just a day or two. Axial3D runs its web-based 3D modeling application on AWS, using Amazon EC2 to host its web platform and Amazon S3 to upload 2D images from MRI or CT scans. The company also uses machine learning models based on Amazon SageMaker to perform fast inference of large medical image datasets.\n\nOne of the clinicians taking advantage of Axial3D\u2019s technology is Dr. Tim Brown, a renal transplant surgeon at Belfast City Hospital in Northern Ireland. Brown recently used Axial3D to generate an accurate 3D model of a father\u2019s kidney in advance of surgery. Using a physical 1:1 scale model of the father\u2019s donor kidney, including a potentially cancerous cyst, Brown conducted a laparoscopic donor nephrectomy with an ex-vivo partial nephrectomy, followed by a living-donor transplantation of the repaired kidney into the daughter. Relying on Axial3D, Brown and his team could prepare better for this complex surgery, reducing variability from 2D imaging and planning the operation more precisely. The 3D model helped Brown educate the patient\u2019s father, who gained a clearer understanding of his condition.\n\nAxial3D is expanding its use of the 3D technology to support additional use cases, including cardiology and urology. The company\u2019s web application enables medical scans to be sent directly from a hospital, processed on AWS, and then sent back to the hospital, improving patient outcomes."
