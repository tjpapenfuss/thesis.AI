    "Summary": "The AWS Partner Network (APN) has developed the APN Navigate program to help companies become more successful in their business differentiation journey on Amazon Web Services (AWS). APN Navigate is a partner\u2019s path to specialization on AWS. The program guides organizations to establish fundamental building blocks that will help them become successful APN Partners. Completing APN Navigate helps partners advance through the APN tiers and prepare for the rigorous validation associated with APN differentiation programs, such as AWS Competency, AWS Service Delivery, and AWS Managed Service Provider (MSP). \n\nThe APN Navigate for SaaS Enablement track has been created to provide resources to understand the fundamentals of building SaaS solutions on AWS. The SaaS Enablement track helps partners develop expertise in designing and implementing end-to-end solutions architecture for cloud-native products on AWS. The program consists of five phases, each containing at least one \u201cApply Your Knowledge\u201d checkpoint that validates an APN Partner\u2019s progression through APN Navigate. \n\nOverall, the APN Navigate program is available to partners as a self-service tool. Business and technical tracks include ongoing enablement through whitepapers, blog posts, webinars, advanced training, templates, and, in some cases, AWS Solution Architect-led boot camps. The program is designed to help companies build a successful AWS-based business, with even more tracks coming soon."
