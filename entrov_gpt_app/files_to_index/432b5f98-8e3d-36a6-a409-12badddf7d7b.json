    "Summary": "Onica, an Amazon Web Services (AWS) Public Sector Partner, has helped deploy a remote access solution with Canada\u2019s Humber College Institute of Technology and Advanced Learning. The solution leverages Amazon AppStream 2.0 and other AWS services to deliver virtual learning applications, enabling 30,000 full-time students to fulfill their learning outcomes during the pandemic. Humber initially sought a proof of concept (POC) to gain confidence in using cloud technology, but the pandemic led to the abrupt shutdown of all Humber campuses. The accelerated solution enables remote access to over 300 academic applications through any device, by any authorized user, in any location as long as they could gain internet access. \n\nOnica designed, tested, and implemented a production-grade Amazon AppStream 2.0 environment integrated with the Humber on-premises data center. It uses Amazon Route 53 for Domain Name System (DNS) resolution, and AWS Network Address Translation (NAT) Gateway gives the private subnets internet access through the internet gateway. The solution also relies on Amazon FSx for Windows File Server for shared file storage, Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) for other data storage, and AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for user and role authentication and authorization. In less than 10 business days, Onica created the application environment that now provides reliable remote application access to all full-time Humber students.\n\nThe project\u2019s success enables Humber to maintain its business model during a shutdown, while giving students the resources they need. Humber College Institute of Technology and Advanced Learning is Canada\u2019s largest college, offering a broad range of advanced academic credentials as well as the latest technology and teaching methodologies across state-of-the-art labs and learning spaces designed to emulate real-world environments and experiences. Onica is a global technology consulting company at the forefront of cloud computing and an APN Premier Consulting Partner."
