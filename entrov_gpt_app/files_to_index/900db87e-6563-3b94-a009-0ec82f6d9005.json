    "Summary": "NorthBay Solutions is a software and technology consulting firm dedicated to helping higher education institutions innovate by moving their critical data to the cloud. As an Amazon Web Services (AWS) Premier Consulting Partner and a member of the Public Sector Partner Program, the organization enables institutions to transform by building new AWS-based software-as-a-service solutions for quickly and securely accessing data. One of NorthBay's clients is Evisions, a software solutions provider for higher education institutions. NorthBay worked closely with Evisions to create an AWS-based transformative platform that features a new data ingestion layer, a software-as-a-service data lake, and a data consumption and access application. These solutions allow customers to expand data access more broadly across campus and automate repeatable tasks, allowing their technology and data experts to solve more pressing problems. \n\nThe platform includes a serverless data model called DORIS, which automatically ingests institutional data, which is then sent to an enterprise data lake. The data access solution, CADMUS, allows customers to quickly and securely query data and create, combine, and extend data collections. Existing customers can connect their current Evisions toolset as one of the data source options. NorthBay and Evisions designed, built, and delivered the new data platform faster than anticipated thanks to NorthBay's OneTeam approach, during which NorthBay teams worked virtually hand in hand with Evisions. \n\nEvisions quickly met its customers\u2019 needs once the new platform was in production. NorthBay's expertise, resources, and approach offered Evisions the agility and velocity to solve market problems faster, enabling their clients to generate more efficient business outcomes. As Evisions explores additional AWS services, the company will be well positioned to support future initiatives. NorthBay's solutions will still be relevant five years from now and beyond, making it possible for institutions to continue meeting their customers\u2019 demands."
