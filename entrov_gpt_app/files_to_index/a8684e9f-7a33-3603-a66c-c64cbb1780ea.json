    "Summary": "Spot by NetApp (formerly Spotinst or Spot.io) is a startup that automates cloud infrastructure to optimize costs, reduce complexity, and ensure performance. The company joined the AWS Partner Network (APN) in 2017 and achieved the AWS Advanced Partner Tier in 2018. In late 2018, Spot.io was invited to be part of the AWS Global Startup Program, which supports mid to late-stage startups in product development, go-to-market strategy, and co-selling. Through the program, Spot.io experienced a 300 percent increase in revenue and a boost in its sales pipeline, with 40 percent of its customers attributed to the program. Spot.io was acquired by NetApp, a cloud data-management solutions provider, in 2020.\n\nThe AWS Global Startup Program offered Spot.io support in building, marketing, and selling its services. Spot.io gained insight into AWS service announcements and received marketing assistance, including online campaigns, webinars, and a billboard in San Francisco. With access to AWS Solutions Architects and account managers, Spot.io was able to better position its products and features in different market segments. The program also allowed Spot.io to engage in conversations with AWS about upcoming services, leading to better customer service and cost savings for its customers. \n\nSpot by NetApp's General Manager and Vice President, Amiram Shachar, credits the AWS Global Startup Program as essential to their success. The program helped them refine their strategy, enhance their go-to-market approach, and deliver better products to their customers."
