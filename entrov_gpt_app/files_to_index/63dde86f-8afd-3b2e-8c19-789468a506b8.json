    "Summary": "VPVision is a telemetry system created by Luxoft and Vantage Power, which provides a deep technical understanding of how individual vehicle components perform in real-time. By connecting to AWS IoT Core, AWS S3, Amazon SageMaker, AWS IoT Greengrass, and AWS Athena, VPVision helps customers bring innovations to market faster, provides safety and compliance controls down to an individual vehicle, and reduces costs through remote diagnostics and edge computing. The platform enables OEMs and Operators to track and monitor components in the field after they\u2019re deployed, preventing potential problems that might arise over the life of the vehicle. \n\nVantage Power uses VPVision to drive its business by speeding up the time to market for new innovations by over six months, by providing safety and compliance controls using predictive analysis, and by reducing costs through remote diagnostics and edge computing. Lithium-ion batteries need to be balanced for optimal performance, which requires the battery to be at a certain charge level for a sufficient period of time. With VPVision, Vantage Power developed a machine learning model using Sagemaker Notebooks, part of AWS IoT Analytics, to automatically analyze a vehicle\u2019s data and identify the ideal time and location for balancing. \n\nGovernments are passing legislation to motivate change, which often mandates that all Ultra-Low Emission Zone vehicles have to meet strict emission control regulations by 2025. Manufacturers of heavy-duty vehicles and vehicle systems want to get new technologies to market fast to respond to the growing legislation and demand. This means that many Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) might ship products earlier than usual, without the years of testing behind more established product streams."
