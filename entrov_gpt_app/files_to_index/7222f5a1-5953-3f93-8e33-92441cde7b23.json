    "Summary": "Trans Austria Gasleitung (TAG) GmbH is a growing natural gas company based in Austria that manages a natural gas pipeline network. To keep up with business growth and optimize critical business applications, TAG decided to move its on-premises data center and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solution to Amazon Web Services (AWS). Working with AWS Partner Network (APN) partner Techedge Group, TAG migrated its SAP environment, B2B application, and other systems to AWS in less than two months. TAG now runs its SaaS solution on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and uses Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) as its primary database for all enterprise application data.\n \nBy using AWS, TAG can scale its applications more easily to expand faster and serve more customers. Additionally, TAG can ensure its applications are always available and meet strict SLAs for uptime. Using AWS has also helped TAG reduce its annual maintenance costs by more than one-third and enabled a 25 percent annual savings compared to a traditional approach to IT capacity management. TAG is also driving innovation and enhancing its service delivery by using microservices and Lambda functions to improve the resilience of data automation flows and to develop a next-generation data analytics and data governance architecture."
