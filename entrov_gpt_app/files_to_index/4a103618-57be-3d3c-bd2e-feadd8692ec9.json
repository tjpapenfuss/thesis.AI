    "Summary": "Axial3D is a medical 3D-printing technology provider that offers patient-specific, accurate 3D-printed models that can be created quickly. The company uses AWS to host its web-based 3D modeling application, and its platform allows surgeons to easily and quickly place orders for 3D-printed models. Axial3D uploads 2D images from MRI or CT scans to Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and then runs machine learning models based on Amazon SageMaker to quickly deploy new models and perform fast inference of large medical image datasets. Axial3D has transformed the process of producing 3D-printed models, which used to take at least six to eight weeks, into a task that can be completed in a day or two.\n\nAxial3D helps surgeons save lives using detailed preoperative 3D medical models. The company creates and delivers 3D-printed models in a day or two, a task that previously would have taken up to eight weeks. Using AWS, Axial3D relied on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) to host its web platform, and Amazon SageMaker and Amazon S3 to help surgeons at Belfast City Hospital successfully perform a kidney transplant that saved two lives. Axial3D specializes in converting images to 3D-printed files that surgeons use for preoperative planning when they need a better understanding of surgeries. \n\nAxial3D is expanding its use of 3D technology to support additional use cases. The company offers a web application that is applicable to any clinician because it enables medical scans to be sent directly from a hospital, processed on AWS, and then sent back to the hospital. Its technology is used by cardiologists and urologists to improve patient outcomes, as these fields involve extremely complex anatomy, and it's critical that surgeons have an accurate presurgery planning tool. Axial3D's customers, like Belfast City Hospital, can empower and educate patients before surgeries by using 3D models to demonstrate anatomy and reference specific problems."
