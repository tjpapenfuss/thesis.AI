    "Summary": "Druva is a cloud-based data protection and governance solution that is trusted by over 4,000 global organizations across all sectors. Druva uses the public cloud to transform data availability and governance, reducing the risk, effort, and cost of managing business-critical information. Druva's solutions, including Druva inSync and Druva Phoenix, offer a single dashboard for backup, availability, and governance, reducing the effort to manage multiple systems. Druva is an AWS Partner Network (APN) Advanced Technology Partner, a Storage Competency Partner, and an AWS GovCloud (US) Skill Technology Partner. \n\nAWS is central to Druva's unified data protection platform. It acts like a distributed file system, providing a centralized store of data that can be accessed by any number of applications that leverage a common architecture, user interface, and security model. Druva leverages the efficiencies, global reach, and native technologies of AWS. By bringing together the cumulative power of AWS, Druva achieves unprecedented performance and capacity on a global scale. \n\nWorking with AWS has allowed Druva to focus on the core of its business and build a scalable, secure, market-differentiating service available to customers globally, rather than worrying about the day-to-day management of infrastructure. Druva has scaled substantially since deploying on AWS, which has enabled over 100% per year growth of the company's customer base over the past four years. Druva plans to continue to work closely with its Partner Manager and additional AWS resources to continue to grow its business with AWS."
