    "Summary": "Arizona State University (ASU) partnered with AWS Partner Sierra-Cedar to migrate its Oracle PeopleSoft applications to the AWS Cloud, using Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) and Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS). ASU uses Oracle\u2019s PeopleSoft applications to manage its large student body, faculty and staff. While the PeopleSoft applications performed well, the university struggled to scale the applications on-the-fly to accommodate peak usage, such as during registration periods. ASU realized greater scalability and cost savings by moving its Oracle PeopleSoft applications to the AWS Cloud, which offered built-in elasticity capabilities that could quickly grow to support peak usage and then release the resources that were not needed when usage returned to normal. \n\nSierra-Cedar took advantage of AWS CodeDeploy and Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) to implement blue/green deployment during migration to the AWS Cloud. This ensured that the system remained available to users throughout the testing and migration phases and when maintenance was performed. Previously, the system would be down for 8-12 hours every month for system upgrades and maintenance. The team also relies on Amazon ECS to host the web and application servers, which makes deploying the infrastructure very fast. Before migrating to the cloud, restarting the PeopleSoft application infrastructure would take up to 45 minutes. With Amazon ECS, redeployment is under 30 seconds. By using Amazon RDS, Sierra-Cedar can manage ASU\u2019s continuously expanding Oracle databases more efficiently. All the functionalities that are central to administering a database, such as patching, upgrades, and backups, are now managed through Amazon RDS. \n\nSierra-Cedar is an information technology professional services firm specializing in system implementations, upgrades, hosting, and managed services for on-premise and cloud-based applications. Sierra-Cedar is an AWS Advanced Consulting Partner, an AWS Public Sector Partner, and an Oracle partner."
