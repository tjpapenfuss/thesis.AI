    "Summary": "Avis Budget Group has partnered with AWS Premier Consulting partner Slalom to use machine learning (ML) on AWS to build an optimization engine for its connected car mobility platform. The company is aiming to create a full transportation platform and is investing in connected devices, modern technology, data, and advanced analytics. Avis Budget Group collects a large amount of data from its car fleet and other sources, and the company needed to ingest, normalise, and analyse the data to achieve its objectives. After evaluating its options, including hosting its own cloud environment, the company chose to build on Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n \nSlalom completed a successful proof of concept (PoC) on AWS and then moved forward with a pilot project at Newark airport. The pilot, which used ML, focused on building an on-site solution that could address the over- and under-utilisation of cars in real-time using an optimisation engine built in Amazon SageMaker. The company plans to roll out the optimisation engine to all of its North American locations by December 2020. Through the PoC, Avis Budget Group found that moving even a small amount on some of its objectives, such as optimising car mileage, translates into significant benefits for the business and its customers."
