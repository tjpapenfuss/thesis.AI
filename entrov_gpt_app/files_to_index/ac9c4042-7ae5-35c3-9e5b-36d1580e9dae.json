    "Summary": "Red River, a technology consulting firm focused on government, education, and commercial customers, participated in the AWS Partner Transformation Program (PTP) to expand its ability to meet the increasing demand for AWS cloud services. Through the PTP, Red River moved from Select to Advanced partner status in just 90 days, unlocking further AWS go-to-market benefits. The comprehensive program helped the company rapidly achieve AWS Advanced Consulting Partner status by assessing and analyzing its existing cloud capabilities, creating a plan of action, and developing cross-functional teams. Red River increased the number of AWS Technical Professional and AWS Business Professional accreditations among its employees from 56 to 552 and grew AWS Certifications from 13 to 68, and it added new packaged service offerings around its core services, including government, networking, storage, DevOps, and migration. As a result of participating in the PTP, Red River has gained major new contracts for its AWS Cloud and AWS GovCloud services, as well as from commercial businesses seeking to comply with government security standards. The company plans to add new AWS Service Delivery Program (SDP) designations and cloud service offerings and invest in leading-edge technologies on AWS such as the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, and artificial intelligence."
