    "Summary": "Northwoods, an AWS Partner Network (APN) Public Sector Partner, has helped Pennsylvania's Erie County Office of Children and Youth to digitize case files, allowing remote caseworkers to serve vulnerable children and families. Northwoods implemented Traverse, its AWS-based solution that provides access to case files from anywhere. The solution uses artificial intelligence to help caseworkers readily access case file information, making it easier to view a child's case history. The mobile application works regardless of connectivity, so caseworkers always have access to the information they need.\n\nThe solution has helped the agency to streamline case management and save time. Erie County's caseworkers can now access files at client sites, which has saved time and enabled them to better stay on top of their caseloads. The agency has also increased the efficiency of its adoption processes. Traverse automatically analyses case information, making it easier for caseworkers and other agency employees to discover the people who are connected to each case and identify placement options for vulnerable children and adults. As a result, the agency has seen a 4 percent decrease in the number of children who are in shelters or other care facilities.\n\nTraverse runs on a range of HIPAA and FedRAMP compliant AWS services, including Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) for on-demand compute, Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) for data storage, AWS Lambda for serverless compute, and AWS Web Application Firewall (AWS WAF), which protects against common web exploits that may affect availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources. The highly available solution is provisioned to give customers a logically isolated environment on AWS."
