    "Summary": "Ar\u00e7elik, a home appliances company based in Istanbul, has started developing appliances that connect to the Internet of Things (IoT). By understanding customer usage, Ar\u00e7elik can make better decisions about product development. The company has built a serverless environment on Amazon Web Services (AWS) to process the 5 GB of data that 32,000 IoT appliances generate each day. To achieve fast, scalable, and fault-tolerant data processing, AWS Lambda functions were built in isolated environments, which help the company manage the events fired by many types of appliances in a single data pipeline. Ar\u00e7elik uses software from APN Partner Thundra to analyze how functions run and optimize them for cost.\n\nThe Ar\u00e7elik team found it difficult to get full visibility into their complex environment using Amazon CloudWatch logs alone. APN Partner Thundra provides serverless monitoring services that enable the identification of bottlenecks and the visualization of serverless transactions with distributed and local tracing combined. The improved observability Thundra provides continues to be valuable as Ar\u00e7elik develops its pipeline to handle new data types from new IoT products. Thundra also helped to reduce the cost of AWS Lambda functions by 50 percent.\n\nAr\u00e7elik's integration of Thundra into its serverless data pipeline with Lambda Layers has helped the team to observe its functions and reduce AWS Lambda processing time and cost. Thundra provides insight that helps Ar\u00e7elik choose the best timeout values and memory thresholds for Lambda functions. Through the use of serverless monitoring services, Ar\u00e7elik has achieved a faster and cheaper serverless IoT environment."
