    "Summary": "Thermo Fisher Scientific, a company that serves the global scientific community with innovative technologies, has developed a connected services solution called Thermo Fisher Connect, in collaboration with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and AWS Partner Cognizant. The platform leverages the power of the cloud, connected devices, and advanced analytics through workflow orchestration, remote monitoring, and predictive maintenance to convert device data into usable information for its customers. Thermo Fisher Connect enables customers to protect critical scientific materials ranging from irreplaceable genetic samples to lifesaving vaccines by eliminating operational risks. \n\nThermo Fisher's ultra-low temperature freezers that allow vaccines to be shipped and stored safely are built using native AWS connectivity linked to the company\u2019s AWS IoT Core infrastructure. To turn the massive amounts of data generated by these devices into actionable insights, Thermo Fisher worked with Cognizant to build Thermo Fisher Connect, a cloud computing platform that links IoT data with advanced analytics tools. The Fisher Thermo Connect platform, created by Cognizant using PTC\u2019s ThingWorx IIoT Platform and AWS IoT services, continuously monitors remote devices and optimizes conditions for scientific samples and products, including temperature-sensitive vaccines. \n\nTo develop the Connect platform, Thermo Fisher and Cognizant established a data lake using Amazon Simple Storage Service to facilitate the information sharing required to drive dynamic reporting and artificial intelligence/machine learning. An integral part of the Connect solution, PTC\u2019s ThingWorx IIoT platform provides the modeling environment to represent the connected assets, such as lab equipment and instruments, along with the telemetry data from these assets. The platform needed to interface with Thermo Fisher\u2019s existing legacy business systems to pull customer, contract, and contact data. Further, as new devices entered the Thermo Fisher ecosystem, there needed to be a way to auto-provision them; there also needed to be a way to create digital twins of those devices and inform the twins with device telemetry and customer data. Finally, the platform needed to connect back to customers through dynamic reporting and advanced analytics to show the health of their devices and the integrity of their materials in time to address any concerns."
