    "Summary": "Lyft, a leading ride-sharing organization, collects millions of data points and metrics from its mobile application, which is critical to the success and growth of its business. However, manually monitoring every metric to detect anomalies in the data was not feasible for the company. To overcome this challenge, Lyft turned to the automation and machine learning capabilities of AWS and Anodot, an AWS Partner Network (APN) Advanced Technology Partner and AWS ML Competency Partner.\n\nAnodot's AI-powered time series analytics solution, built on AWS, uses advanced machine-learning algorithms to identify potential problems in real-time without having to inspect multiple dashboards. By using Anodot and AWS services such as AWS Kinesis Streams, Lyft is now able to detect business incidents quickly and understand the scope and root causes of issues across millions of metrics.\n\nOverall, Lyft's partnership with AWS and Anodot has enabled the company to accurately detect anomalies at scale and identify potential problems in real-time, which is critical to the health and growth of its business."
