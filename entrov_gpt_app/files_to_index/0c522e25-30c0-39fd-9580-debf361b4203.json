    "Summary": "Capgemini, a technology services company and member of the AWS Partner Network, built an AI tool using AWS services to identify sperm whales with 97.5% accuracy in minutes. Capgemini's team developed the tool during its annual Global Data Science Challenge, which empowers its team to develop AI and machine learning solutions to address single-use cases. The winning team worked with Whale Watch Azores marine biologist Lisa Steiner to develop the tool, which matches sperm whale flukes with high accuracy. Capgemini has been using cloud technologies since 2008 and became an AWS Partner in 2012. Capgemini is committed to environmental sustainability and reversing climate change.\n\nAs a member of the AWS Public Sector Partner Program, Capgemini's Global Data Science Challenge often focuses on issues related to public sector research. Capgemini chose whale conservation as the theme for its 2020 competition and worked with marine biologist Lisa Steiner, who has conducted sperm whale research for over 30 years. Matching flukes was a time-consuming process, so the Capgemini team used Steiner's photos to create an integrated solution to help researchers better understand migration patterns, genealogical lines, and other information that provides insight into the sperm whale's way of life. During the 2020 GDSC, Capgemini employees built AI-based solutions to help Steiner streamline the fluke matching process.\n\nAs an AWS Partner, Capgemini has the resources and support it needs to deliver innovative solutions to its customers. The company is expanding its sperm whale solution to include other species, such as humpback whales. It also hopes to enable greater collaboration by creating a centralized, scalable database where whale researchers can upload images and better identify individual animals. Capgemini is launching a co-innovation program called Responsible Earth with the support of AWS to generate awareness around greener information technology. Through this program, the company aims to develop solutions that not only are useful for its customers in traditional ways but also drive sustainability and new lines of business."
