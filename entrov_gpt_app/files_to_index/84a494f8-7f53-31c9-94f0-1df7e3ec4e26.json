    "Summary": "Stylight, a fashion search engine, faced a challenge of managing thousands of product images provided by multiple online shops and retailers, ensuring that they all looked great and loaded quickly. They decided to use Cloudinary, an APN Advanced Technology Partner with AWS Competencies in Digital Customer Experience and Retail. Cloudinary provides multiple image resolutions, scaling, quality optimization, and automation features, including automatic format selection and automatic quality compression, which optimizes size and format and has a significant positive impact on page load time, performance, and visitor satisfaction. Stylight also uses Cloudinary\u2019s lazy loading feature, which speeds up page load time by about 100 milliseconds across all locations, enhancing user experience and improving the click-out conversion rate (COCR) anywhere from 0.4% to 2.2%, depending on the country. This has increased Stylight's revenue per visit by the same proportion and has therefore significantly improved monetization. \n\nStylight uses a microservices-based architecture, and the team responsible for enriching the products by tagging them to appear in the appropriate categories is also responsible for uploading the images into Cloudinary. The Product team, responsible for the client-facing parts of Stylight, consumes a REST API including the Cloudinary image IDs and applies certain transformations via Cloudinary\u2019s unique URL-based solution to ensure those images appear as intended on the site. Recently, Stylight began leveraging Cloudinary\u2019s multi-CDN capabilities, which dynamically switches between multiple content delivery networks \u2013 Akamai, Fastly, and Amazon CloudFront \u2013 to serve images closer to Stylight\u2019s end-users to speed page load time and prevent costly downtime of Stylight\u2019s site. \n\nCloudinary has become the de facto solution for web developers and marketers to manage images, videos, and other rich media assets and deliver an optimal end-user experience. Powered by Amazon Web Services (AWS), Cloudinary benefits from AWS\u2019 secure, reliable, scalable, and highly-performant global infrastructure. Cloudinary adheres to the AWS Well-Architected Framework and best practices for operational excellence, security, reliability, performance, and cost-efficiency. Cloudinary has more than 5,000 customers worldwide, including AMC, Bleacher Report, Cars.com, Conde Nast, DoorDash, Fairfax Media, Forbes, Gizmodo, GrubHub, Hinge, Indiegogo, Lululemon Athletica, Outbrain, Stitch Fix, StubHub, Under Armour, and Whole Foods Market."
