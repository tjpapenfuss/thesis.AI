    "Summary": "Library and Archives Canada (LAC) partnered with TeraMach, an AWS Public Sector Partner, to implement a digital preservation solution hosted in the AWS Cloud. The system runs on Amazon EC2, using Amazon S3 for storage and Amazon VPC for internal networking. The collection managed by LAC includes 20 million publications in various languages, 250 linear kilometers of government and private text records, 30 million photographic images, 550,000 hours of audio and video recordings, and much more. Its digital holdings total 18 petabytes (PB), growing by 1.25 PB annually\u2014a figure set to increase rapidly in the coming years. With the growing capabilities of the cloud, LAC saw an opportunity to improve the scalability, agility, and efficiency of its operations while improving access to information for the people of Canada. \n\nThe cloud-based solution has streamlined the preservation workflow, freeing specialized staff for value-added tasks. For example, the organization previously had multiple ways for publishers to submit books and periodicals, including via email, requiring significant manual work from LAC librarians. Now, the web front-end handles the ingestion process through a standardized form. TeraMach helped LAC expand their understanding of what a solution could be and met with the team weekly to adapt as new requirements became apparent. LAC is continuing to roll out new functionality, such as the ability for universities to submit research theses and automatically link them to the LAC catalog. In addition, the organization is piloting digital ingestion with government departments in preparation for the full-scale implementation of its digital-only mandate."
