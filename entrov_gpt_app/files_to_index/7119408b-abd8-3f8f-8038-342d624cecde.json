    "Summary": "Collinson, a global organization that delivers traveler experiences, medical and security assistance, travel medical services, and insurance products to its corporate customers and partners in 13 countries, engaged with Freshworks, a company that provides cloud-based omnichannel engagement solutions, to replace its legacy telephony platform with the Amazon Connect omnichannel cloud contact center. Freshworks used Amazon Web Services (AWS) to run Freshdesk and its other software solutions. With the help of Freshworks and AWS, Collinson automated operations and shifted from a CapEx-based cost model to a consumption-driven model. \n\nThe Freshdesk omnichannel solution, including Amazon Connect calls, email, and Freshdesk Messaging on social media, helped Collinson to offer COVID-19 testing facilities at partner airports. Its system now handles 1,200 testing-related chats per day across 13 testing sites in the US, the UK, and the Asia-Pacific region. As part of its contact center transformation, Collinson introduced bots and automation into its communications, resulting in improved agent productivity and customer interactions. The Freshdesk ticketing dashboard also helps Collinson to better track customer interactions across channels, and agent productivity has improved as a result. \n\nWith Freshworks and AWS, Collinson has also been able to experiment with new apps to solve its challenges and implement solutions independently, shortening the development cycle from weeks to days. Integrations are also simplified with Freshdesk, and the company has customized a Freshdesk app to integrate with multiple Trustpilot accounts to collect and monitor customer opinions. Collinson benefits from a predictable operation cost model with both Freshworks and AWS."
