    "Summary": "Northwoods is an AWS Partner Network (APN) Public Sector Partner that provides software solutions to help human services organizations manage, collect, view, and share content and data more efficiently. One of their primary solutions for child welfare is Traverse, an application that uses artificial intelligence to help workers readily access case file information, making it easier to view a child's case history. The Erie County Office of Children and Youth, a child welfare agency, engaged Northwoods to automate the flow of client and case information and digitize all case files to solve its data collection problems. \n\nTraverse runs on a range of HIPAA and FedRAMP compliant AWS services, including Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) for on-demand compute, Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) for data storage, AWS Lambda for serverless compute, and AWS Web Application Firewall (AWS WAF), which protects against common web exploits that may affect availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources. During the COVID-19 global pandemic, Northwoods' solution allowed caseworkers to access case files from anywhere, enabling the agency to quickly pivot and continue serving vulnerable children and families. \n\nThe Northwoods solution has helped Erie County Office of Children and Youth caseworkers save time, streamline case management, and spend more time helping children and families. The agency has also increased the efficiency of its adoption processes. Northwoods plans to continue using new AWS services as it works to enhance its application, and Erie County Office of Children and Youth continues to use the Northwoods solution to keep children safe and respectfully engage families."
