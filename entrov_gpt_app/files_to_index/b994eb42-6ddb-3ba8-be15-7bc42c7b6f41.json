    "Summary": "FranklinPlanner, a company that provides paper planning systems to help people achieve their goals, needed a faster, cheaper platform and a partner who could work with their in-house team in a more cooperative, intuitive manner. They chose Pivotree, an APN Advanced Consulting Partner with AWS Competencies in Oracle and Retail, who offered substantial cost savings and Oracle Commerce application expertise. Pivotree created an end-to-end Oracle hosting solution on AWS, which included Managed Application Services, the flexibility of the AWS cloud, and load testing to ensure the site could handle traffic. The new FranklinPlanner site went live in May 2018 and resulted in a 40% reduction in hosting and support costs. \n\nBy selecting the AWS cloud hosting solution, Pivotree delivered the flexibility and scalability that FranklinPlanner needed to innovate while retaining the stability and performance of a traditional bare metal solution. Network changes are completed within days instead of weeks, and tickets are handled much faster than with the previous hosting provider. FranklinPlanner's internal team is now free to focus on the development and optimization of the on-site customer experience. Pivotree's customer-centric culture, innovative solutions, team skillset, and great attitude were some of the reasons FranklinPlanner decided to partner with them.\n\nPivotree is a leading end-to-end provider supporting clients from strategy, platform selection, deployment, and hosting through to ongoing support. Pivotree solutions start with reliable, world-class Commerce and Master Data Management platforms fitting a variety of client needs, situations, and budgets. Pivotree is a trusted partner to over 200 market-leading brands and forward-thinking B2C and B2B companies, including many Fortune 1000."
