    "Summary": "Dressbarn, a US-based women's clothing retailer, recently closed all 650 of its physical stores and transformed into a 100% online retailer. To support this transition, Dressbarn selected N2WS Backup & Recovery for AWS to improve operations, implement cross-region disaster recovery, and protect its critical workloads. N2WS Backup & Recovery provides a single dashboard to centralize and automate Amazon EC2 backup, database backup, and disaster recovery using native snapshot technology. Dressbarn is now using N2WS Backup & Recovery for AWS to protect its Amazon EC2 instances, and it was up and running with backups within a couple of days. N2WS also enabled Dressbarn to implement cross-region and cross-account disaster recovery for encrypted Amazon Aurora, Amazon DynamoDB, and Amazon Redshift instances.\n\nDressbarn chose Shopify to run its online store and Amazon Web Services (AWS) for its backend systems. N2WS was selected by Dressbarn to provide a comprehensive tool that is easy to manage and provides all the critical information needed with one glance. Robert LeVine, a technology consultant for MySite Group LLC, said using N2WS gives him peace of mind that their data protection needs are taken care of. Dressbarn is constantly trying to increase its stock-keeping unit (SKU) count and customer options, so preventing data loss is critical. By leveraging AWS to focus on ecommerce and N2WS to scale backup and disaster recovery, Dressbarn is well positioned to provide excellent service, ensure customer data is fully protected, and excel as a traditional retailer reborn in the digital age.\n\nN2WS, based in West Palm Beach, Florida, provides enterprise-class backup and disaster recovery solutions for multiple AWS Cloud services. N2WS's Cloud Protection Manager is a backup solution for Fortune 500 companies, enterprise IT organizations, and managed service providers operating large-scale production environments on AWS."
