    "Summary": "The Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport (CVG) has implemented advanced technologies, such as computer vision (CV), to improve its operations and traveler experience. TaskWatch\u2019s Attntiv CV application on AWS Panorama notifies staff of critical events in real-time, such as congestion at passenger pick-up/drop-off zones or waiting for specific services for an aircraft on the tarmac that can lead to unnecessary flight delays. Previously, CVG relied on radio communications and on-the-ground observers as the basis for many of its operations, from managing curbside traffic flow to on-time flight departures.\n\nCVG experimented with computer vision but found most solutions too complex and costly to deploy. They partnered with TaskWatch, which offers real-time AI analytics for CCTV feeds, and piloted the solution using both TaskWatch and Amazon Web Services (AWS) with a six-month pilot. CVG identified two areas that needed immediate solutions: traffic on the tarmac and vehicle flow at curbside drop-off and pick-up. TaskWatch designed a computer vision traffic management system that runs on AWS Panorama and established task-generating thresholds as defined by CVG.\n\nCVG has seen success with TaskWatch and IoT sensor integrations for restroom cleanliness purposes, a critical element to an airport\u2019s overall customer satisfaction performance. The new system is resulting in more orchestrated traffic management, a safer airport, and is making it easier for attendants to do their job\u2014without the constant cacophony of radio communications. CVG is applying the solution to other scenarios, including anomalies like unattended luggage or a passenger\u2019s medical emergency."
