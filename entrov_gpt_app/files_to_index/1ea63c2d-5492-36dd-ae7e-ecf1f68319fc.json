    "Summary": "The AWS Partner Network (APN) Blog features an article that highlights the role of distributors like Ingram Micro Cloud in enabling partner success. As the shift to cloud continues, distributors have pivoted from their traditional transactional role to playing a more strategic function in the channel. AWS Distributors work closely with AWS to serve as an extension of the AWS field teams, and they are key contributors in enabling partner growth and APN advancement, opportunity acceleration, and speed to market. Distributors provide value to their AWS Partners in four key areas: sales enablement, practice development, technical enablement, and business and financial support.\n\nIngram Micro Cloud is a global AWS Distributor that supports hundreds of AWS Partners from the registered level all the way to Premier Partners in both commercial and the public sector. As a distributor, Ingram Micro Cloud can pass down additional benefits that partners can leverage for their end customers. Distributors capable of accessing higher-level programs can pass down these benefits to its partners and enable them to develop a greater competitive advantage that wouldn\u2019t be achievable otherwise. The article also provides a distribution success story that highlights how Data Canopy, a hybrid infrastructure provider, leveraged Ingram Micro Cloud\u2019s deep bench of AWS Certified professionals and expertise around the AWS Cloud Adoption Framework to win a sizable project with Itiviti, a leading technology and service provider to financial institutions worldwide. \n\nThroughout the multi-year global strategic collaboration between Ingram Micro Cloud and AWS, both organizations will accelerate initiatives to increase reach and footprint in existing geographic markets and expand into new ones to provide this level of distributor support for more partners globally. Ingram Micro Cloud will develop new solutions and services to enable and augment the service capabilities of AWS Partners to drive greater AWS adoption across SMB end customers, as well as scale AWS adoption with emerging ISVs."
