    "Summary": "StackArmor is an Amazon Web Services (AWS) partner that helps government and defense organizations achieve their regulatory compliance objectives. The company offers threat intelligence, cybersecurity, compliance-focused solutions, and managed services. StackArmor's customers must comply with federal security requirements, such as those aligned to the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA), and Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC). To assist its customers in reducing the time required to achieve Authority to Operate (ATO) on AWS, stackArmor chose to apply for the ATO on AWS Program.\n\nThe ATO on AWS Program affords AWS partners access to technical support experts and security strategists and provides vetted security and compliance through technology partners such as Splunk and Telos. By joining the ATO on AWS Program, stackArmor gained a competitive advantage, enabling it to differentiate itself from thousands of other AWS Partners and build its business in a specialized way. The ThreatAlert ATO Accelerator on AWS reduces the time and cost of meeting ATOs by 40 percent.\n\nSince joining ATO on AWS, stackArmor has successfully supported over 20 FedRAMP, FISMA, and Department of Defense Controlled Unclassified Information (DoD/CUI) ATOs. The company has nearly doubled its revenue since joining the program and has established strategic partnerships with Splunk and Telos. The ATO on AWS Program has helped stackArmor concentrate on its superpowers and connect rapidly with customers who need its solution."
