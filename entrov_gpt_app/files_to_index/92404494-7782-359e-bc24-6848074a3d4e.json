    "Summary": "Cloudticity is an APN Advanced Consulting Partner and AWS Managed Service Provider (MSP) with AWS Competencies in DevOps and Healthcare. Founded in 2011, Cloudticity focuses on providing healthcare-specific consulting and technology management services and solutions. Cloudticity has always had a technology strategy and focus on Amazon Web Services (AWS). Cloudticity joined the AWS Partner Network (APN) as soon as it began its AWS-based consulting practice. The company sought out APN Programs to help the company reach its target audiences and differentiate from the market. \n\nCloudticity is a small, nimble team with a specific niche defining its business. It sought to mature into a Next-Generation MSP practice with the help of the APN. Cloudticity focused much of its effort on its financials, sales, and marketing plans to meet and exceed the bar set by the AWS MSP Program. DevOps is the beating heart of the Cloudticity MSP practice. Cloudticity makes more per head than the average MSP given its automation-first practice. Today, Cloudticity offers its customers managed services, managed security, and managed compliance through Cloudticity Oxygen, the company\u2019s proprietary managed services platform. \n\nMichigan Health Information Network Shared Services (MiHIN) worked with Cloudticity to digitally transform and migrate to the AWS Cloud. Today, MiHIN is an innovator in the healthcare interoperability technology space. Crucial to MiHIN\u2019s ability to drive its mission forward is its technology footprint and ability to scale. MiHIN worked with Cloudticity to fully migrate to the AWS Cloud within 90 days. The organization uses the Cloudticity Oxygen platform and works with Cloudticity as its managed service provider. MiHIN has worked with Cloudticity to generate cost savings and evolve its expertise of and experience with AWS."
