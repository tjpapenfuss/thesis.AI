    "Summary": "The West Windsor-Plainsboro Regional School District in New Jersey has partnered with VMware, an AWS Public Sector Partner, to deliver uninterrupted virtual education to its 10,000 students and save 50-75% on hardware replacement costs, all while ensuring data recovery in just 10 minutes. By using VMware Cloud on Amazon Web Services (AWS), the district was able to provide seamless access to critical learning applications for students and teachers. The district turned to VMware Cloud on AWS to extend its on-premises VMware vSphere environment to provide critical learning applications and infrastructure during natural disasters such as hurricanes. The district immediately saw the safety of being on the cloud when strong storms hit the region. \n\nSeveral months after deploying VMware Cloud on AWS, West Windsor-Plainsboro Regional School District faced a new challenge when the state governor closed all schools and issued a stay-at-home order for all residents. To meet this challenge, the district suggested expanding the use of VMware Cloud on AWS beyond disaster recovery to make virtual resources available to all staff and students teaching and learning from home. Using VMware Cloud on AWS, West Windsor-Plainsboro Regional School District ensures educational services can continue during a statewide school shutdown. As a result, the district can provide the same learning experience for teachers and students that they are used to, even while state schools remain closed. \n\nBy moving workloads to AWS, the district saves money by avoiding the need to buy and replace physical hardware. This is because VMware Cloud on AWS ensures high uptime, which is essential for critical learning applications. The district can now grow its IT infrastructure instantly without investing additional resources in its on-premises environment to facilitate the transition to virtual classrooms. Overall, West Windsor-Plainsboro Regional School District is better prepared to ensure application uptime and seamless education, regardless of storms or school closures."
