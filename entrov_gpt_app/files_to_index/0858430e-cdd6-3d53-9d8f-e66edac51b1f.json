    "Summary": "Cogo, a climate-focused technology company and AWS Partner, built a carbon footprint tracking feature on AWS for National Westminster Bank (NatWest) to support the bank's commitment to a nationwide transition to a net-zero, climate-resilient, and sustainable economy. Using Amazon API Gateway, AWS Lambda, and Amazon Aurora, Cogo integrated the feature into NatWest's retail banking app via an API, empowering customers to track how their spending impacts the climate and offering suggestions on how they can reduce their carbon footprint. The carbon tracking feature from Cogo is a differentiator for NatWest and demonstrates the bank's commitment to helping the UK achieve net-zero emissions.\n\nBanks can integrate carbon footprint tracking into their digital offerings to help customers understand the impact of their spending and influence sustainable behavioral change. NatWest contracted Cogo to integrate a carbon footprint tracker via an API into its retail banking app, with agility, security, and low latency as requirements. Cogo built the API for NatWest on the AWS Cloud, using AWS Lambda, Amazon ECS, Amazon API Gateway, Amazon Aurora, and Amazon SQS. After completing a successful pilot, NatWest integrated the carbon footprint tracking feature in its personal financial management app within six months, launching ahead of COP26.\n\nNatWest's carbon footprint tracking feature helps its 8 million retail banking customers measure, understand, and reduce their carbon emissions. During the pilot, NatWest tracked an average monthly CO2 reduction of 11 kilograms per user, thanks to actions taken by customers using its new feature. If scaled across NatWest's entire customer base, this would equate to 1 billion kilograms of CO2 annually \u2013 an equivalent of planting 17 million trees. The carbon tracker plays a role in helping customers understand the impact of their daily actions and is a big stepping stone toward meaningful climate impact education."
