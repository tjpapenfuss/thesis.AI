    "Summary": "DataVault Innovations, a data services division of CanDeal, has partnered with TickSmith, an APN Advanced Technology Partner, to develop a data pooling solution for Canadian banks that is designed to ensure compliance with the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB) regulations as well as monetize their investment in data. The solution will reduce the cost of capital set aside for at-risk assets and generate new revenue by selling the pooled data to the markets. TickSmith worked closely with DataVault Innovations to deliver a full data management stack and advanced processing capabilities. The platform runs on Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) capabilities to auto scale processing tasks, efficiently handling any volume of data. \n\nEach bank requires access to the shared platform to normalize and collect their proprietary data securely at scale, as well as to receive derived content from the collective data pool. The data pooling solution developed by TickSmith has broken new ground in big data technology, handled millions of OTC instruments from different sources, and consolidated data for modellability in producing collective data. Recent FRTB pooled data shows one bank getting a 667% increase in securities considered modellable, with the average being more than 400% for all the banks. CanDeal is a leading institutional electronic marketplace for Canadian debt and derivatives trading, while TickSmith offers a big data software platform - GOLD - that gathers, organizes, leverages, and distributes data for democratization, market surveillance, and analytics for capital markets and financial firms."
