    "Summary": "Peak is a decision intelligence company that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to help businesses unlock the power of their data and make commercial decisions. With its full-stack AI platform, Connected Decision Intelligence (CODI), the company relies on machine learning (ML) across sales, marketing, planning, and the supply chain to accelerate revenue and profits for its customers. Peak became an AWS Partner in 2014 and has since gained AWS Competencies in ML and retail. Peak achieved the AWS Retail Competency in 2019, which recognizes AWS Partners that provide innovative technology offerings to accelerate retailers\u2019 digital transformations across their entire enterprises.\n\nBy using AWS Competencies as a way to expand globally and develop its ability to provide AI to retailers, Peak has grown quickly and emerged as a force in the retail business sector. Peak's retail opportunities have grown by 113% since becoming an AWS Retail Competency Partner in January 2020. Gaining this AWS Competency has enabled Peak to improve visibility in front of retail businesses that fit its ideal customer profile, helping it land customers such as Nike, KFC, PepsiCo, Superdry, and PrettyLittleThing. As an AWS Partner, Peak gets support from AWS product teams and industry vertical teams to help facilitate innovation.\n\nPeak also offers a 21 Day Challenge, in which Peak uses an AWS service alongside CODI to show tangible benefits to a business through the power of ML in just 21 days. For example, the 21 Day Personalize Challenge uses Amazon Personalize alongside CODI to demonstrate how ML can boost a business\u2019s ecommerce revenue. Through the 21 Day Challenge and Peak\u2019s other offerings, Peak provides its customers with reports that make it simple for them to track the impact being made. As Peak continues to grow as an AWS Competency Partner, the benefits trickle down to its customers."
