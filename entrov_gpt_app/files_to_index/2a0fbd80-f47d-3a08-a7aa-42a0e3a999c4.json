    "Summary": "Aguas Nuevas is a Chilean water services company that provides drinking water and wastewater services to over 400,000 customers across the country. The company has a mission to satisfy its customers' needs, care for the environment, and help develop the cities in which it works. To achieve this, the company constantly streamlines and enhances its IT operations for its customers and approximately 1,300 internal users. Aguas Nuevas has partnered with Morris & Opazo, an AWS Advanced Consulting Partner, to move important IT operations to the cloud using Amazon Simple Email Service, Amazon S3 for database backup and data recovery, and Amazon Redshift for data warehousing. \n\nMorris & Opazo has been a trusted ally of Aguas Nuevas in communications and IT strategy for nearly a decade. The cornerstones of their collaborative relationship are tacit knowledge sharing and ongoing training. Together, they have successfully completed more than 100 projects. Morris & Opazo's experts were on hand to provide advice and assistance to Aguas Nuevas teams during the ideation, proof of concept, and implementation phases. Morris & Opazo is always looking for the newest and best technologies, offering recommendations, holding meetings, and giving presentations.\n\nThe cost transparency that AWS provides with its pay-as-you-go model was especially appealing to Aguas Nuevas, as the Chilean government regulates the final price of water services for consumers, so Aguas Nuevas has to ensure that its operations are as lean as possible. AWS provides cost-for-use flexibility that has driven the decision to keep innovating. Aguas Nuevas is using cutting-edge cloud technologies with the help of Morris & Opazo and AWS to increase efficiency and better serve its customers."
