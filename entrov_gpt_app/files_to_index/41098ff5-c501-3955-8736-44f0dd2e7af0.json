    "Summary": "The roles of CFOs and CIOs in many enterprises have been veering away from the strategic focus that one would expect from CXOs. However, to succeed in the digital world, enterprises must let their CIOs and CFOs re-establish a focus on strategy, empowering them to move away from operational concerns. A truly strategic CFO role is about making the right investments to drive company growth and profitability, actively managing the company\u2019s risk posture and using data to drive the company\u2019s operational performance. Similarly, a strategic CIO role would focus on guiding the enterprise through the digital world, formulating company strategy based on a deep understanding of digital technology and its possibilities, and driving innovation. \n\nFor the CFO and CIO roles to become more strategic, they need to empower one another. The CFO cannot accomplish his or her objectives without the CIO\u2019s active participation, and vice-versa. The CIO\u2019s role involves identifying, collecting, storing, and extracting value from the company\u2019s data. The CFO is the steward of the organization\u2019s performance and operational data, overseeing its analysis and presentation to the board, and helping the company use data to drive business outcomes. Together, they can maximize the data\u2019s value for driving performance. \n\nThe CFO and CIO can work together to find ways to invest nimbly and to take advantage of the faster pace of IT execution to manage risks in IT investments. Instead of committing up front to large, drawn-out, risky initiatives, the company can stage its investments, reviewing progress frequently and adjusting as necessary. They can work together to ensure transparency into costs and set guardrails and controls that manage those costs to maximize profitability. The CIO and CFO together can look to minimize costs per unit of revenue, thereby allowing for growth while still managing the bottom line."
