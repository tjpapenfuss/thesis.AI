    "Summary": "DPG Media, an international media company, successfully launched its video-on-demand (VOD) service called VTM GO with the help of APN Partner Gremlin and AWS. DPG Media aimed to ensure that its cloud architecture for VTM GO was resilient to system failures, and Gremlin's chaos engineering solution helped the company test the reliability of its software systems. Through controlled experiments, DPG Media detected and fixed 35 priority software bugs before VTM GO went live. On the day of the launch, the number of concurrent viewers was 130% bigger than expected, but DPG Media was able to handle the additional workload through the scalability of VTM GO's microservices architecture running on the AWS Cloud. Today, DPG Media creates new services using AWS Lambda in six hours.\n\nDPG Media launched VTM GO, a VOD platform, in April 2019. The company looked to apply chaos engineering to its software systems to run reliability checks. Gremlin's software helped DPG Media recreate real-world failure scenarios and avoid any cracks in its software when VTM GO went live. VTM GO runs on the AWS Cloud and is built using microservices with Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) for orchestration, allowing DPG Media to handle unexpected viewing peaks. In addition, the DPG Media IT team conducts 24-hour hackathons to drive innovation, and in a recent hackathon, AWS Lambda enabled the team to set up a complete video-ingest transcoding flow in less than six hours, eliminating the time-consuming job of manually categorizing videos on the website.\n\nDPG Media's mission is to inform, entertain, and inspire readers, viewers, and listeners with strong, well-known brands in publishing, broadcasting, and online services. Gremlin helps companies test the reliability of their cloud architectures through its chaos engineering platform-as-a-service solution that empowers engineers to inject failures into their software to see the results and take remedial action."
