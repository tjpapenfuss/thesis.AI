The automotive industry is experiencing a shift in consumer preferences, with younger buyers seeking fuel-efficient, high-tech vehicles and digital retail experiences. To adapt to these changing demands, car manufacturers like Ford Motor Company are turning into data companies. Ford, having learned from its previous failed attempt at digital transformation in 2014, has now fully embraced it as a key enabler of its transition from an auto manufacturer to a high-tech data company. 
Ford is investing in big data analytics and AI, with two new data centers announced to handle anticipated data volume increases, and a strategic partnership with Google to modernize IT systems and leverage data for revenue, customer experience, and innovation. Google's AI technology will be used to improve vehicle development, supply chain, and manufacturing operations, while Ford vehicles will be outfitted with built-in Google apps like maps and voice technology.
Google Cloud and Ford have partnered to digitally transform the automotive company's operations and improve customer experience. This collaboration aims to modernize product development, enhance manufacturing, and optimize supply chain management. Additionally, the partnership seeks to use computer vision AI for employee training and assembly line equipment inspection.

The three main objectives of the partnership are:
1. Improving customer experience with personalized technology and services.
2. Accelerating product development, manufacturing, and supply chain management.
3. Speeding up real-time customer notifications for maintenance and other activities.

One of the primary objectives is data monetization. Ford aims to identify and cultivate this through insights and analytics, which will help develop better in-car features such as safety systems or infotainment systems. This data can also be sold to insurance companies or other businesses for strategic purposes.

Ford's IT team has developed a massive data lake to understand and develop new business models, combining internal and external data from over 4,600 sources. This system enables innovative services such as predictive maintenance, supply chain analytics, and EV optimization. In 2020, Ford used this data to launch a usage-based auto insurance program with OnStar vehicle data, offering tailor-made rates based on individual driving behavior and vehicle safety system usage.
