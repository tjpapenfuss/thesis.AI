The automotive industry is experiencing a shift in consumer preferences, with younger buyers seeking fuel-efficient, high-tech vehicles and digital retail experiences. To adapt to these changing demands, car manufacturers like Ford Motor Company are turning into data companies. Ford, having learned from its previous failed attempt at digital transformation in 2014, has now fully embraced it as a key enabler of its transition from an auto manufacturer to a high-tech data company. 
Ford is investing in big data analytics and AI, with two new data centers announced to handle anticipated data volume increases, and a strategic partnership with Google to modernize IT systems and leverage data for revenue, customer experience, and innovation. Google's AI technology will be used to improve vehicle development, supply chain, and manufacturing operations, while Ford vehicles will be outfitted with built-in Google apps like maps and voice technology.
